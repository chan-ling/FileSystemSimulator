# FileSystemSimulator
Application Name: File System Simulator

This Java console application simulates a basic file system using a tree structure. It allows users to create directories, navigate through the file system, and list the contents of directories.


Why I made this application :
  I made this as a learning exercise to explore data structures like trees and their real-world applications. It provides a simple and interactive way to understand how a file system is organized and how directories are structured hierarchically.

Contribution:
 This application can be helpful for beginners learning about data structures and algorithms. The code is simple and easy to understand, making it an ideal starting point for exploring tree-based implementations. It also provides a hands-on experience of simulating a basic file system, which can be beneficial for understanding the underlying principles of file management.
